## Starter app for the Maple Mini on ChibiOS

This is the sample demo that was supplied with the ChibiOS demos, broken out into its own directory to be put under source control.

It serves as a minimal application for testing that your tool chain is properly setup, and as an easily clones starting point for other ChibiOS projects on the maple mini.
